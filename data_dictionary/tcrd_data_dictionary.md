Note that allele origin refers to an observation of a variant, not the variant itself, so the same variant may have been reported both as germline and as somatic.                                                                                                                                                     |

|  44 | cmpd_activity          | lychi_h4              | The NCATS Layered Chemical Identifier (LyChI) is a chemical standardization tool that generates a unique hash for chemicals that is layered and used for quick fuzzy uniqueness checks and searches. A unique feature of the LyChI hash keys is that they are, to a certain extent, lexicologically meaningful (https://github.com/ncats/lychi). Level 4 of the identifier is used here.                                                        |

| 107 | drug_activity          | lychi_h4              | The NCATS Layered Chemical Identifier (LyChI) is a chemical standardization tool that generates a unique hash for chemicals that is layered and used for quick fuzzy uniqueness checks and searches. A unique feature of the LyChI hash keys is that they are, to a certain extent, lexicologically meaningful (https://github.com/ncats/lychi). Level 4 of the identifier is used here.                                                        |

| 391 | rat_qtl                | lod                   | A statistical estimate of the likelihood that a trait is associated with a locus on a chromosome.  A LOD score of three or more is generally taken to indicate that the locus contains genes that influence the trait.  LOD scores of less than 3 can indicate loci that have limited but “true” influence on a trait, eg when a trait is controlled by several genes at several loci, and none of the genes by itself determines the phenotype |
