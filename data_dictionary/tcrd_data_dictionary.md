|  44 | cmpd_activity          | lychi_h4              | The NCATS Layered Chemical Identifier (LyChI) is a chemical standardization tool that generates a unique hash for chemicals that is layered and used for quick fuzzy uniqueness checks and searches. A unique feature of the LyChI hash keys is that they are, to a certain extent, lexicologically meaningful (https://github.com/ncats/lychi). Level 4 of the identifier is used here. |

A unique feature of the LyChI hash keys is that they are, to a certain extent, lexicologically meaningful (https://github.com/ncats/lychi). Level 4 of the identifier is used here. |
